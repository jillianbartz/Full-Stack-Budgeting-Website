4. Application Name​: EZBudget

5. Application Description​:

	EZBudget is an application that allows users to track their monthly income and allocate spending to the overall budget. The application will allow users to create an account that will store their personal budget information which can be accessed through the login page. EZBudget will ask users for monthly or bi-weekly incomes, as well as any spending that the user wants to include. There will also be individual categories for spending, including food, rent, car payments, or other monthly expenses. The application will provide the total sums of their personal spending for each category on their budget tab, as well as their net profit for each month. EZBudget will also allow users to receive investment recommendations using a stock API built into the application.
	
	The EZBudget application is extremely useful for all individuals looking to become more aware of their spending habits. This application can be a quick resource for individuals to see their budget without having to independently compute their profits. EZBudget will provide simple information regarding the user’s categorical spending habits, providing the opportunity for more productive budgeting in the future months. The application will include monthly tabs that can show the user’s overall progress as well as useful recommendations regarding stock investments the user can make.
